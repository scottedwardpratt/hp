conductivity_all: conductivity from 2+1 flavours, fig 10 (bottom)
conductivity_light: conductivity when the current only contains two flavours, fig 10 (top)
conductivity_strange: conductivity when the current only has the strange quark, fig 10 (top)

diffusion: diffusion coefficient, fig 14

conductivity and conductivity_all are identical

chi_I, chi-Q, chi-B for fig 4 left
chi-LL, chi-SS for fig 4 right
